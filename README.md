# OiX-2016---Understanding-Weather-Impact-on-Beer-Sales-in-Denmark
This is a project for the Open Innovation X Challenge organized by DTU (Technical University of Denmark). 
The goal is to build a system to understand the effect of the weather on beer sales in Denmark. A second part of our project aims to predict those effects.

1. We provide an explenation of the effects of the weather on the beer sales
2. We provide a model to predict beer sales depending on the weather forecast
